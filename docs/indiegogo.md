# Pitch Text

## Short Summary

Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust.
Here are some things to do in this section:

- Introduce yourself and your background.
- Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.
- Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.

Remember, keep it concise, yet personal.
Ask yourself:
If someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?


## What We Need & What You Get

Break it down for folks in more detail:

- Explain how much funding you need and where it's going.
    Be transparent and specific - people need to trust you to want to fund you.
- Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!
- Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.


## The Impact

Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how
the difference their contribution will make:

- Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.
- Point out your successful track record with projects like this
    (if you have one).
- Make it real for people and build trust.


## Other Ways You Can Help

Some people just can't contribute,
but that doesn't mean they can't help:

- Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.
