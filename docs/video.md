## Version 1: Education hasn't changed

Hey everybody,
my name is Adrian. I'm a software engineering student and today I'd like
to introduce you to Educatopia.

Over the last hundred of years our world has undergone tremendous
changes. Nothing is is like it has been before ... except for one thing:
our education. Children still sit in classrooms with chalk boards and
try to keep up to outdated frontal teaching. Students still waste their
time in crowded lecture halls listening to often badly prepared
lectures. Going to school is almost like time travelling. You will get
prepared for a world which does not exist anymore with techniques that
should have been overhauled long ago.
I think it's obvious - our educational system is completely broken. But
that's enough complaining … let's fix it.

But we were tired of complaining and that's why …

Our first step towards this ambitious goal is to build a community
driven and open source website which hosts an extensive database of
exercises and their solutions. Everybody will be able to upload new
exercises and modify existing ones.

Exercises really build the foundation of education. They enable us to
practice our knowledge, they enable us to figure out what we already
know and what we still need to learn and most importantly they enable us
to solve real problems.

Unfortunately there are no good resources on the internet. You might
find a few exercise sheets on university websites or in school forums
but that's just it.

To master a subject, however, you need to solve tons of exercises, you
need the correct solutions for them to be able to compare them with
yours, you'll want to get hints when you're stuck and you will want to
know how long it should take you to solve the exercise.

But that's really just the beginning:

But this are really just the basics:

Imagine metrics which show you how well you performed in comparison to
others or even exercises which adapt automatically to make you practice
the things you still need to improve on.

All of that will be possible with your help.

So please pledge for Educatopia and help us build the first piece of the
education of tomorrow!
This project really means a lot to us and we will give our best to make
it really great!

Thank you so much for your help!

We can't wait to get really started.


## Version 2

2 Years ago I was learning for my final exams in high school.
During that time I was reflecting what my last 13 Years at school had been like.
Of course it had been a great journey, however, I felt like the whole
system was broken …

First time put it all in one website, perfect

2 Years ago when I had this idea

Learned a lot of things meanwhile

Now feel finally ready to

Both of my parents are teachers.

Let's really make the world a better place and not just enhance your
photos with cheesy filters.

System of "Checks and Balances"

3 Years ago when I was preparing for my final exams at high school I
finally realized how broken our education system is.

There are already sites like khan academy, ... however they lack the
golden thread

Our ultimate goal is to be able to provide first-class education and to
be able to grant certificates which are accepted world wide!
